## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}
pokemon <- read.csv("data/pokemon.csv")

pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)

pokemon <- pokemon %>% filter(type_1 == "Bug" |
                                type_1 == "Fire" |
                                type_1 == "Grass" |
                                type_1 == "Normal" |
                                type_1 == "Water" |
                                type_1 == "Psychic")

pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(pokemon$type_1)
pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(pokemon$legendary)
pokemon$generation <- as.factor(pokemon$generation)

```

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
set.seed(11)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(pokemon, prop = 0.8, strata = type_1)
pokemon_training <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_testing <- testing(pokemon_split)

```

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_training, v = 5, strata = type_1)

```

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense +
                           hp + sp_def, data = pokemon) %>% 
  step_dummy(legendary, generation) %>%
  step_center(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def) %>% 
  step_scale(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def)

```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

```{r}
pokemon_training %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric), -x) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = "lower")

```

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

_The variable total is moderately to strongly positively correlated to all of the other variables. This makes sense because total is a sum of all the other variables. Additionally, defense is strongly positively correlated with sp_def, which makes sense since some Pokemon are probably strong at both aspects of defense._

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
class_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

```

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)

```

_The roc_auc is pretty high for a smaller penalty, peaks a bit after 0.01, then falls sharply near 0.1. It seems that single decision trees perform better with a smaller complexity penalty._

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

collect_metrics(tune_res) %>% arrange(desc(mean))

```

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = pokemon_training)


class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()

```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

```{r}
rand_forest_spec <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

rand_forest_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rand_forest_spec %>% set_args(mtry = tune(),
                            trees = tune(),
                            min_n = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

```

_mtry is how many predictors will be chosen to be available at each split in the tree._\
_trees is the total number of trees made._\
_min_n is the number of data points that much be left at a node for another split to occur._

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
rand_forest_param_grid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1, 7)), 
                                            trees(range = c(64, 128)),
                                            min_n(range = c(30, 150)), levels = 8)

```

_A model with mtry = 8 would just be selecting all of the predictors instead of taking a random sample._

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
tune_res_rand_forest <- tune_grid(
  rand_forest_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = rand_forest_param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res_rand_forest)

```

_A higher roc_auc is yielded by lower minimal node sizes and greater than 3 randomly selected parameters. The best value for number of trees is difficult to distinguish from the graphs._

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res_rand_forest) %>% arrange(desc(mean))

best_params_rand_forest <- select_best(tune_res_rand_forest)

```
_Our best roc_auc is 0.7324599 when we use mtry = 5, trees = 91, and min_n = 30._

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}
rand_forest_final <- finalize_workflow(rand_forest_wf, best_params_rand_forest)

rand_forest_final_fit <- fit(rand_forest_final, pokemon_training)

#vip(rand_forest_final_fit)

```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

```{r}
boost_spec <- boost_tree() %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boost_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(boost_spec %>% set_args(trees = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

boost_param_grid <- grid_regular(trees(range = c(10, 2000)), levels = 10)

tune_res_boost <- tune_grid(
  boost_wf, 
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = boost_param_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(tune_res_boost)

```



What do you observe?

_The roc_auc increases steadily until it levels a bit about 0.73._

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res_boost) %>% arrange(desc(mean))

```

_We have a mean of 0.7321208 for trees = 894._

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

```{r}
single_tree_metrics <- collect_metrics(tune_res) %>% arrange(desc(mean))
best_single_tree <- single_tree_metrics[1, 'mean']

rand_forest_metrics <- collect_metrics(tune_res_rand_forest) %>% arrange(desc(mean))
best_rand_forest <- rand_forest_metrics[1, 'mean']

boost_metrics <- collect_metrics(tune_res_boost) %>% arrange(desc(mean))
best_boost <- boost_metrics[1, 'mean']

bind_rows(best_single_tree, best_rand_forest, best_boost) %>% mutate(model = c('Pruned Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Boosted Tree'))

pokemon_model_final <- finalize_workflow(rand_forest_wf, best_params_rand_forest)

pokemon_final_fit <- fit(pokemon_model_final, data = pokemon_testing)

```

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

```{r}
final_fit <- augment(pokemon_final_fit, pokemon_testing) %>% roc_curve(truth = type_1, estimate = c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic))
final_fit

autoplot(final_fit)

augment(pokemon_final_fit, new_data = pokemon_testing) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")

```

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

_My model was most accurate at predicting normal and fire. It was worst at predicting psychic and water._

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
